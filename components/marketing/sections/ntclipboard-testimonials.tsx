            'I have been in manufacturing since 1993. And during this time I have worked with many traditional software companies, all of whom over promise and under deliver. EDGEBIC is different. Their singular focus is building your production efficiency, not theirs. When their systems work, they put the pedal to the floor and press on. When required, they pivot quickly to adapt and adjust. Their singular goal is to keep their clients at the top of the ever-changing manufacturing landscape. I love this company and will be a partner for life.',

To break into this market and stand out, I deployed EDGEBIC\'s production optimization strategies. I started with their scheduling optimization that resulted in 2 major efficiency improvements and the identification of cost savings that I implemented within 3 weeks of the optimization campaign. What I also found interesting is that our customers remember us for our efficiency and called us the go-to manufacturing partner from beginning to end.',
