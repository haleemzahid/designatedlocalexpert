      answer:
        'NTClipboard works with any PDF containing structured data like parts lists, inventory documents, job sheets, and technical specifications. It uses intelligent pattern recognition to identify part numbers, descriptions, quantities, weights, and job numbers.'

      question: 'How secure is my data?',

        'Your data never leaves your computer. NTClipboard processes everything locally on your Windows machine, ensuring complete privacy and security. No internet connection is required for the core functionality.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What keyboard shortcuts are available?',
      answer:
        'NTClipboard includes several time-saving shortcuts: ESC to clear, TAB to send selected items to clipboard, and ` (backtick) to view current clipboard contents. The app also minimizes to system tray for quick access.'

    //   question: 'Can I customize the output format?',

    //     'Yes! You can select specific items from parsed data, merge multiple entries, and the output is formatted perfectly for pasting into spreadsheets, databases, or any application that accepts text input.'
    // },

    //     "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If NTClipboard doesn't meet your needs or work with your specific PDF format, we'll provide a full refund, no questions asked."
    // },
    {
      question: 'How does the intelligent parsing work?',
      answer:
        'NTClipboard uses advanced pattern recognition to identify structured data in PDFs. It looks for common patterns like part numbers (100-xxxxx), quantities, weights, descriptions, and job numbers, then organizes them into a clean, selectable format.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use NTClipboard on multiple computers?',
