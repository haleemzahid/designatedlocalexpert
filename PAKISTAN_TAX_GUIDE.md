# Pakistan Tax Configuration Guide

## Why Tax Shows PKR 0.00

When tax shows 0 in Stripe checkout for Pakistan, it's usually because:

1. **No tax registrations configured** in Stripe for Pakistan
2. **Automatic tax not enabled** for Pakistan region
3. **Business location not set** correctly
4. **Pakistan tax requirements** not configured

## ðŸ”§ Solutions for Pakistan Tax

   - **Display name**: "Pakistan Sales Tax" or "GST"
   - **Percentage**: 17% (standard Pakistan GST rate)
   - **Jurisdiction**: Pakistan
   - **Type**: GST/Sales Tax
   - **Active**: âœ… Enabled

3. **Copy the Tax Rate ID** and update your `.env`:

```env
# Uncomment and update with new tax rate ID
PRO_PRODUCT_Tax_ID=txr_your_new_pakistan_tax_rate_id
```

### Option 2: Configure Automatic Tax for Pakistan

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard** â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Tax settings**
2. **Business information**:
   - Set your business address in Pakistan
   - Add Pakistan tax registration number if applicable
3. **Tax calculation**:
   - Enable automatic tax calculation
   - Configure Pakistan-specific settings

### Option 3: Address-Based Tax Detection
